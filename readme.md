# Simple DNF

Simple DNF intends to be a **fast** and **simple** GUI to manage packages and perform basic operations, like *Synaptic* but for DNF-based Linux distributions.

Initial Roadmap :

- [x] View of available and installed packages
- [x] Async cache loading
- [ ] Ability to install / remove
- [ ] Detailed view of package
- [ ] Sorted views
